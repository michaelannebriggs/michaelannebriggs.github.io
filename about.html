    <p>
        I'm a recent graduate with a Bachelor's of Arts in New Media and a minor in Computer Science 
        from the University of North Carolina at Asheville. My focus is on 2D hand-drawn animation, 
        and I'm always improving my skills in digital illustration, storyboarding, Adobe Software, Maya, 
        HTML/CSS, and Java programming. My dedication to my craft was recognized when my project 
        "Phases" won Best In Category for Installations at the UNCA Student Juried Exhibition in Spring of 2024. 
        For this project, I collaborated with four others to create a projection installation.
         I applied my animation skills to produce 2D GIFS that, alongside 3D models and edited videos, 
         explored the phases of a tragic love story. Now, I'm seeking work at an animation studio as a storyboard
          artist or animator. I'm also experienced in coding and virtual reality game production.
           My commitment to my work and continuous skill improvement are what drive me in my pursuit of a career
            in animation and digital art.
