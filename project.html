            <h2><i>Phases</i>, 2024</h2>
            <p>This senior capstone project was a collaborative projection installation that incorporated 3D 
                models and animation, video editing, and 2D animation all timed together with ambient music to 
                create an experience by projecting these creations in a space where viewers can sit or walk 
                around. Phases brings the viewer through a story of a tragic love story. The collaborators 
                believed that all tragic love stories have 4 phases: Butterfly, Honeymoon, Plateau, and 
                Ultraviolence. We represented these phases with motifs and symbols in the 3D models/animation, 
                video footage, and 2D animation. Each phase has its own mood and themes and they each are a 
                minute long with 5 seconds transition. This installation was part of The 2024 New Media Juried 
                Student Exhibition at UNC Asheville and was chosen as the winner for the Best in Installation 
                category.</p>

            <h2><i>Barbie 3D Model</i>, 2023</h2>
           <p> A 3D model of a Barbie-themed bedroom created in Autdodesk Maya. I first took measurements of my own room 
            and created a blueprint floor plan. I imported the blueprint into Maya and started creating furniture assets
            to scale starting off with simple shapes, like cubes, and extruding it and modifying it to make it look 
            like furniture. After all the assets were created, I UV-mapped the assets in order to create texture maps
            using normal displacement maps. I applied the materials and textures to all the assets using Arnold 
            materials. I then used Arnold lighting to light the room to create a warm and welcoming environment.
            I then rendered it.</p>

            <h2><i>Grimace 3D Model</i>, 2023</h2>
            <p>A 3D model of a McDonald’s adult happy meal toy, Grimace. It was created in Autodesk Maya.
            I took reference pictures of the actual figure and then imported it into Maya to make sure the 
            3D model was on scale. I used one shape, a cylinder and kept manipulating the mesh by extruding.
            After the model was done, I created a UV map and imported it into Photoshop. 
            I painted the map purple and painted the eyes. Then, in Maya, I hooked up the UV map from Photoshop 
            to the model. I added lighting and then rendered using Arnold. </p>

            <h2><i>Rose Madder: Temple of the Bull</i>, 2024</h2>
            A storyboard for a scene derived from the novel Rose Madder(1995). It depicts the scene where the 
            main character, Rosie, discovers her newly bought painting is more than just a painting. I used
            various of shots to depict the suspenseful and high-tension mood of the scene. Her reactions of her
            environment were a big part of the storytelling, so I focused on close-ups shots and over-the-shoulder shots.

                A storyboard for a 2D animation that is about a boy confiding in his talking computer about his
                 crush. I layed out each of the shots with the dialogue. I started off with a medium close-up of
                  the main character, the boy, and then used over-the-shoulder shots with the boy and his 
                  computer to show the exchange of the conversation. I used close-ups on both the boy and the
                   computer to show their reactions and emotions.

                red or blue pill and tells him the truth about his reality. I remade the scene by replacing 
                Morbius and Neo with characters from a anime called Jujutsu Kaisen, where the characters 
                Gojo Satoru and Yuji Itadori, have a similar relationship as Morbius and Neo, where Gojo 
                helps Yuji enter a world that was unknown before. I studied each shot in order to learn from 
                a professional work and remade it with the new characters.

                and emotions. Using Adobe After Effects, I created text and graphics and animated them to create 
                a relaxing, use-to-following video. There are three parts: a breathing exercise where the viewer matches
                their breathe to the rhythm of the animated circles, a colorful animation where the user just has
                to sit and watch and let their mind empty; and finally some words of affirmation and helpful tips to stay

                A Photoshop composition depicting black plague doctors in a modern hospital in lab coats 
                standing over a dead patient. This was made during the COVID-19 lockdown. I used the lasso 
                tool to extract the plague doctors and skull and placed them on the doctors and patient in a

                A mock concert poster made with Photoshop. It is a remix with MC Escher’s “Relativity” and the 
                musical artist Billie Eilish. I used the lasso tool to extract Billie from high-resolution photos
                 and placed her in the work “Relativity.”  I adjusted the color balance, brightness, and contrast
                  to blend all the elements together so that Billie was part of that world. I chose compelling 
                  text and arranged the elements symmetrically to contrast the “randomness” with the image.
